# FEM-Simulation
FEM-Simulation of a one-dimensional electromagnetic wave in a homogeneous medium.

You can change the parameters in test.py and run the simulation. Then you see 2 plots of the material parameters and the original wave. After waiting a short time (depend on the parameters: number of FE, order of the shape functions, ...) the simulation should start. 

 For the python simulation you can choose:
 
1. The material parameters: conductivity and permittivity over the domain.
2. Number of finite elements.
3. Order of the shape functions (eg. quadratic functions).
4. Type of shape functions (Hierarchical, Lagrange).
